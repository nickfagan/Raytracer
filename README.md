Raytracer
=========

A raytracer I intially created for my fourth year computer graphics course in University. Since then I have made a number of changes such as utilizing threads to reduce run time, switching form using lua to json to define scenes, and cleaning up / commenting alot of code.

<b>Features:</b>
- Directional lighting
- Specular and diffuse materials
- Reflective materials
- Soft shadows
- Anti-aliasing
- Multithreading
