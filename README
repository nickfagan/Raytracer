The final executable was compiled on this machine: g11

How to invoke my program: 
./rt filename

How to use my extra features: 
I added recursive ray tracing to create reflective surfaces. I modified scene_lua to parse a new material called ref_material that takes all the same parameters as the normal material and an extra parameter to specify the relectiveness of the surface, 0 means no relfection and 1 means teh surface is perfectly reflective.

I set up my unique scene so that there is a reflective sphere on top of a reflective box so you can see multiple levels of reflection (I set the max times a ray can be reflected to 8)

I have created the following data files, which are in the data directory:
simple.lua

My program assumes the following: 
I did not get hierarchical transformations working.
